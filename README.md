## Description

CSEC_CPD is a collection of algorithmic problem solutions, coding challenges, and small utility scripts written in Python (and occasionally C++).  
It acts as a portfolio / practice repository to track progress in competitive programming, algorithmic puzzles, and general coding exercises.

## Features

- A wide variety of solved problems (e.g. sequences, geometry, string manipulation)  
- Clean, well-commented Python code  
- Problem-wise organization so you can easily navigate by topic  
- A “Team” folder and other categorized sections for special projects

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages:** Python (main), C++  
- **Tools:** Git / GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter, (Replit for demos)  
- **Concepts:** Algorithms, data structures, problem solving, computational geometry, sequences, etc.
